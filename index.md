# Photogrammetry - Data Collection Tutorial
Created by Jack Biggs

### What is photogrammetry?
* At its simplest, photogrammetry is the creation of a 3D model in digital space from multiple photographs of an object, interior or exterior space, or person
* Photogrammetric software takes these images and stitches them together to create a model that replicates the subject’s shape, color, and texture

### Why use or implement photogrammetry into academic research?
* Data capture is relatively easy and cheap given the right circumstances
  * Processing software is not usually free but is readily available in the DHI Lab for any Anthropology Dept. faculty, graduate student, or undergrad
* Digital preservation/curation of fragile materials that may disappear or break down over time
* Scaled photogrammetric models can be exported in a number of file types and loaded into different modeling or statistical software for quantitative analyses 
  * Ability to have data easily available without having the object right in front of you
* Creates a more interactive and tangible experience with an object compared to just an image
  * Easily share models and embed them into presentations

## What are the data used in photogrammetry?
* Contrary to what you might think, the 3D models are not the actual data, but the visualizations of the data
* The images you capture are the true data in photogrammetry and must be treated as such
 * Models are likely to be less accurate if the lighting and background setup and camera settings are not considered
 * The images are analogous to the rows, columns, or even individual cells in a spreadsheet of data – missing or miscalculated values can result in an inaccurate or skewed representation or analysis of those data

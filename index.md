# Photogrammetry - Data Collection tutorial
Created by Jack Biggs

## What is photogrammetry?
* At its simplest, photogrammetry is the creation of a 3D model in digital space from multiple photographs of an object, interior or exterior space, or person
* Photogrammetric software takes these images and stitches them together to create a model that replicates the subject’s shape, color, and texture

## What is photogrammetry?
* Data capture is relatively easy and cheap given the right circumstances
** Processing software is not usually free but is readily available in the DHI Lab for any Anthropology Dept. faculty, graduate student, or undergrad
* Digital preservation/curation of fragile materials that may disappear or break down over time
* Scaled photogrammetric models can be exported in a number of file types and loaded into different modeling or statistical software for quantitative analyses 
** Ability to have data easily available without having the object right in front of you
* Creates a more interactive and tangible experience with an object compared to just an image
** Easily share models and embed them into presentations

## What are the data used in photogrammetry?
* Contrary to what you might think, the 3D models are not the actual data, but the visualizations of the data
* The images you capture are the true data in photogrammetry and must be treated as such
** Models are likely to be less accurate if the lighting and background setup and camera settings are not considered
** The images are analogous to the rows, columns, or even individual cells in a spreadsheet of data – missing or miscalculated values can result in an inaccurate or skewed representation or analysis of those data

## Collecting the data (taking the photos)
Photos used in photogrammetry must be taken in a specific way and must meet a certain set of criteria:
_The number of photos_ – there is no set number of photos required to create an accurate 3D model
The number of photos will change depending on the size, shape, scale, and type of object you’ll be shooting
More than required is better than not enough – you can always disable or not use some images in the model-making process 


On the dashboard, there is a navigation bar on the left and the main work area on the right.  "Manage Resources" provides links and summary accounts for Items, Item Sets, Vocabularies, and Resource Templates. "Manage Sites" lists all sites within the Omeka S installation.  Clicking on the name of a site will direct users to the public view, while clicking on the edit button (pencil icon) will direct users to the editing base.  

## Navigation 

On the left-side navigation column, users will see a section heading for "Resources."  This contains all of the tools to build content in Omeka S: 
* Items 
* Item Sets
* Vocabularies
* Resource Templates

Below these options the user will see the the Administrator system settings to manage all websites on the Omeka S installation, including: 
* Users (single or batch-add)
* Modules (plug-ins to extend functionality)
* Jobs
* Settings

## Key Terminology and Concepts

* Item:  A digital representation of a piece of content in which you can attach metadata and upload multiple forms of media.  Items are the building blocks of every Omeka platform, but function a little differently in Omeka S. When users click on the pencil "edit" icon, it will take them to an interface where they will enter metadata information. A new feature is that users will choose which metadata fields they would like to complete based on a list of four different "Properties" that will appear in a side bar on the right side of the screen. Here, users can choose fields from the property lists: 
  * Dublin Core (Omeka's standard metadata fields)
  * Bibliographic Ontology
  * Friend of a Friend (Ideal for genealogical projects)
  *Example: Usually a primary or secondary source such as a painting, document, legislation, interview clip, book, newspaper, etc
   
* Item Set: A group of "Items"  organized around a similar inherent features, like an idea, person, or place.  If multiple Items have the same owner/contributor or archival/museum collection, then creating an Item Set for these objects is an appropriate form of organization. Every Item Set will have its own metadata, and is structured very similarly to "Collections" in Omeka Classic.  The difference is that any Item can appear in one or more Item Sets as users deem necessary.
*Example: The Item Set titled: "William Shakespeare" would include include the Items: ''Romeo and Juliet'', ''Othello'', and "Macbeth."

A new feature of Omeka S is the ability to enter an existing Item or Item Set as the value for a property field.  For example, the Item Set based on "William Shakespeare" can be entered into the "Author" field of an Item. This way, any work with the same author will be connected together.

* Resource Templates: Allows users to create custom sets of metadata properties from any of the categories or a combination of them, and name it. You can then select the resource template when creating an Item or Item Set and it will be added to the metadata form. This feature can simplify the workload when adding a multitude of similar items. This function is similar to "Item Type" in Omeka Classic, but has more flexibility in type-specific metadata.

## Adding and Managing Content

* Create a Website:  On the Admin dashboard, select the "Add Site" button which will open a New Site start-up page with fields to enter the website title and URL slug (or Omeka will generate one automatically). The next tab shows the choices for different themes of appearance. Lastly, the "Item pool" tab is where you can create pools of items between Omeka sites and set specific search settings.

When you are done, click "Add" and your new site will appear on the dashboard ready to upload and manage content. 

* Items
To add an item, follow these steps: 
1. Go to "Items" under resources and then click the gray button "Add new item." 
2. Select a resource template that best applies to the item's type (film, artwork, textual work, a custom template, etc.).  Also select a "class" to claim a metadata type.  
3. Adding a resource template and class will change the kinds of metadata fields available to enter information. To add more fields,     
   skim through the "properties" column on the right side of the page and choose which fields you would like to add to your item's 
   metadata information.  Choose properties from "Dublin Core," "Bibliographic Ontology," and "Friend of a Friend" as the user sees
   appropriate for their item. 
4. Click the media tab to upload media from your computer, through a URL, HTML, IIIF image, oEmbed, or Youtube.  
5. Select the "Item set" tab to add the item to a pre-created Item set. (i.e.  This is where authors might connect their works to a
   specific donor, artist, creator, etc.).
6. Lastly, click "Add" and the item will appear in the list with the others.  Edit the item at anytime by selecting the pencil icon.

* Item Sets: 
To create an item set, follow these steps:
1. Click the "Item Sets" tab from the left navigation column on the dashboard, then click "add new item set."
2. If you have a resource template preference, you may select a specific resource template. Otherwise, select Dublin Core, Bibliographic Ontology, or Friend of a Friend from the right column and enter the metadata information available for the item set.  

* Pages to a Website:
To edit and add new pages to a website, follow these steps:
1. Using the left navigation column on the admin dashboard, you can edit existing pages or "Add new page." 
2. Once you add a new page, enter a title and click "add." You will then be directed back to the interface for all pages.  Click the pencil "edit" icon to edit and add content to your page.
3. In the edit interface, notice the selection of content blocks that you can add to the page.  Once you add your content blocks of choice, you can drag them to reposition their order on the page.  
4. Various content blocks allow text, media (items), and mapping features.  
5. Once your a finished with the content, layout and design of your page, click "save." 
## Practice More with the Sandbox
* Learn how to use Omeka S by experimenting with their [http://dev.omeka.org/omeka-s-sandbox/login Sandbox](http://dev.omeka.org/omeka-s-sandbox/login Sandbox). It comes pre-populated with items, item sets, resource templates and websites. Users can practice uploading their own content as well.
    *Log in with one of the following accounts
           omekasdemo1@example.com
           omekasdemo2@example.com
           omekasdemo3@example.com
    Passwords for each account are the username in the email address (omekasdemo1, etc).
